## Inventory Application Outage Postmortem - March 8th, 2024

**Issue Summary:**

Our internal Python inventory management application experienced a service disruption on Friday, March 8th, 2024, between 1:15 PM SAST and 2:00 PM SAST (45 minutes). This impacted 100% of users (approximately 50 warehouse personnel) and resulted in the inability to access or update inventory data. The root cause was identified as a faulty code deployment introducing an infinite loop.

**Timeline:**

- **1:15 PM SAST:** Monitoring alerts signaled a significant rise in application response times.
- **1:16 PM SAST:** An on-duty engineer investigated the alert, suspecting a database connection issue initially.
- **1:20 PM SAST:** Database examination confirmed normal operation, shifting focus to the application server.
- **1:30 PM SAST:** Code review revealed a recently deployed code change containing an infinite loop. This loop consumed all available CPU resources.
- **1:45 PM SAST:** The development team was notified, and a rollback of the recent deployment was initiated.
- **2:00 PM SAST:** The application successfully rolled back to the previous version, restoring normal response times and user access.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

The outage stemmed from an infinite loop introduced during a recent code deployment. This loop caused excessive CPU usage on the application server, leading to slow response times and eventual crashes. The issue was resolved by reverting to the previous stable application version.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

- **Enhanced Code Review Process:** We will implement a more rigorous code review process to identify potential infinite loops and other critical errors before deployment. This may involve static code analysis tools or pair programming for sensitive code changes.
- **Improved Monitoring:** Our current monitoring will be expanded to include CPU utilization metrics. This will enable swifter detection of resource bottlenecks and prevent similar outages in the future.
- **Automated Rollback Procedures:** We will investigate implementing automated rollback procedures triggered by specific monitoring thresholds. This would expedite recovery times in case of critical issues.

This postmortem highlights the importance of preventative measures and a robust development process. By implementing the corrective actions outlined above, we aim to prevent similar outages and ensure the continued smooth operation of our inventory management system.
